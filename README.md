# HTML/CSS Accessibility Refactor

## Description

- The goal of this project was to refactor an existing project to make it more accessible. The webpage was a mockup landing page for a company called "Horiseon", and included several navigation links and a body section that explained the service. The site also included several photos, icons, and an aside panel with more information. Our user story asked for a codebase that followed accessibility standards so that the site would be optimized for search engines. This included refactoring the HTML to include semantic HTML elements, restructuring the HTML so that it followed a logical structure, and included alt attributes on all photos and icons. 

- I built this project to better understand accesibility standards with HTML & CSS. It can be easy to fall into the habit of using ```div``` and ```span``` elements, so it's crucial to implement good habits at the start of my education. This project made me consider alternative solutions by requiring the use of semantic HTML elements. It also made me consider the important components of a photo that someone would need to know, assuming they're not able to view it - what's occuring? Who's in it? What are the background details? What's the setting? Finally, altering the layout of the HTML & CSS made me consider the readibility of the codebase. Ensuring the code followed a logical progression was something I hadn't considered until completing this project.

## Usage

The page can be accessed via Github pages, at https://ericlyn4s.github.io/html-css-accessibility-refactor/. From here, you can read about the Horiseon product it's offerings. You can also verify the code accessibility by looking at the developer console (Ctrl + Shift + I).
